# Schimpfomat
Schimpfomat is the result of a binary nighmare due to daylight saving switch. The app violates you after you told your name, so watch out!

Tired of of searching for efficient accusations towards others on social networks? Well, beginning with v2.0, Schimpfomat can do this for you by copying a created sentence into clipboard. Anyhow, it will only be usefull for discussions in german language, I'm afraid...

This app is entirely written in pure FreePascal/Lazarus. Feel free to use or missuse it as you want, as long as you don't belong to some fascist party or vote for AfD.
